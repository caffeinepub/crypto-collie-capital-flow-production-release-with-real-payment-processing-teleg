  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements. All three modal components (SubscriptionModal, ProfileSetupModal, PaymentConfirmationModal) have been updated with solid dark backgrounds (bg-slate-950/bg-slate-900) and emerald/cyan gradient styling consistent with the GlobalCapitalFlow aesthetic. No transparent backgrounds remain in the modals.",
